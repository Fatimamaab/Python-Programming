# Python-Programming
This repository showcases my work and learning journey from a foundational programming course. The course covered both theoretical and practical aspects of programming, focusing on solving introductory problems using a precise, specification-oriented approach aligned with unit test standards.

Key highlights include:
Core programming concepts and problem-solving techniques.
An introduction to object-oriented programming (OOP).
Application of selected third-party libraries for enhanced functionality.

Through this course, I gained hands-on experience and developed the skills needed to write reliable, efficient, and maintainable code. The repository contains examples, assignments, and projects that reflect my progress and understanding of these topics.
